# Llanbedr_Airfield_GPR_Data_Segmentation

Segmentation of the GPR is conducted in Mathworks MATLAB 2017a, using conventional image segmentation tools coded into a semi-automated algorithm. This is applied to data in the timeslice domain, to optimise the appraisal of the spatial dimensions of targets within any one depth interval. The algorithm is tuned to maximise its sensitivity to the lithological layers and buried structures that appeared in the GPR data.
